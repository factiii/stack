# @factiii/auth

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 7dfe209: Split @factiii/auth 2FA into clean standard and device modes, and ship Claude Code skill scanfixes from @factiii/stack.

  **@factiii/auth**
  - `createAuthRouter` now selects its router shape from `features.twoFaMode`. Default is the new `'standard'` mode (user-centric TOTP with `User.twoFaSecret` + `User.twoFaBackupCodes`). Set `features.twoFaMode: 'device'` and pass a `deviceAuth: DeviceAuthAdapter` to opt into the legacy mobile-bound flow used by factiii.
  - New exports: `StandardAuthRouter`, `DeviceAuthRouter`, `TwoFaMode`, `DeviceAuthAdapter`, `createPrismaDeviceAdapter`, `AUTH_PRISMA_MODELS_STANDARD`, `AUTH_PRISMA_MODELS_DEVICE`, `getAuthPrismaModels`. `AuthRouter` is preserved as an alias of `StandardAuthRouter`.
  - Reference Prisma schema split: `prisma/schema.prisma` is now `prisma/schema.standard.prisma` (default) and `prisma/schema.device.prisma` (legacy). Update `package.json#exports` consumers — the old `./prisma/schema.prisma` subpath has been removed.
  - `SessionWithDevice` moved from `./adapters/database` to `./adapters/deviceAuth`.
  - Restored the required `User.updatedAt` column in both schema variants — login/refresh embed `updatedAt.toISOString()` in the cookie payload, so omitting it crashes auth at runtime.
  - Drops the redundant `User.twoFaEnabled` flag in standard mode; `twoFaSecret != null` is the source of truth.

  **@factiii/stack**
  - New `claude-skills` scanfix replaces the older `prod-check-skill` scanfix, installing the `commit`, `push`, and `prod-check` Claude Code skills under `~/.claude/skills/` for factiii-pipeline repos.
